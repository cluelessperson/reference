# partitioning disks is typical and often even required (windows)
# it's usually just used to divide up the disk so you can use it ofr multiple types of storage/things

# this just sends a bunch of commands to fdisk for you
# I suggest you run fdisk yourself though, for learning
(
echo g # Create a new empty DOS partition table
echo n # Add a new partition
echo p # Primary partition
echo 1 # Partition number
echo   # First sector (Accept default: 1)
echo   # Last sector (Accept default: varies)
echo w # Write changes
) | fdisk /dev/mapper/<NAME>
