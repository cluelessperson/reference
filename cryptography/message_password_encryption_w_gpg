# symmetric means same password/key to encrypt and decrypt
# AES256 is considered all around "safe"
# THIS IS ONLY AS "SAFE" AS YOUR PASSWORD
# armor means it's displayed nicely as human readable text, instead of just bytes/data

gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo=AES256 --armor
# Ctrl+D to finish message

gpg --decrypt
# Paste message
# enter password
